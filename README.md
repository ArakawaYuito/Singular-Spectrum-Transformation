# Singular Spectrum Transformation
Anomaly Detection with Singular Spectrum Transformation. This method constructs a trajectory matrix consisting of time series data sub-series and decomposes it using singular value decomposition. It detects anomalies by determining the distance between subspaces and calculating the angle of variation.
